DATA contains the properties delimited by ":" regarding:

i) structure (xyz filename) = first column
   - note that the mono/bis-23/bis-25/bis-26/tris order is followed in the DATA file (delimited by, e.g.,  "----- mono -----")
   - optimized using SMILES -> babel 3Dgen XYZ -> gfn0-xTB MD -> idecon connectivity check -> gfn2-xTB opt -> RI-PBE0-D3/def2-SVP CPCM(DMF)

ii) HOMO-1 orbital energy = second column
   - calculated as the single-point at the DFT (RI-PBE0-D3/def2-SVP CPCM(DMF)) level of theory

iii) HOMO orbital energy = third column
   - calculated as the single-point at the DFT (RI-PBE0-D3/def2-SVP CPCM(DMF)) level of theory

NOTE: All of the calculations are performed on the 'biradical' oxidation state of quinone = total charge -2, multiplicity = 1; except for structures with substituents containing "[N](C)(C)C" substring that are positively charged. Based on the number of these 
substituents, up to charge +1 for "XX[N](C)(C)C_XX[N](C)(C)C_XX[N](C)(C)C" is achieved.
